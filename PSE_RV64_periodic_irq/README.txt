                 PolarFire SoC MSS Timer Periodic IRQ example
================================================================================

This example project demonstrates the use of the PolarFire SoC MSS timer
Periodic IRQ of a 32 bit timer. This example uses timer 1 configured as a
periodic timer to generate interrupts. The delays of the interrupt are fixed to
demonstrate the occurence of interrupts at periodic interval of time.

                            How to use this example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To use this project you will nee a UART terminal configured as below.
    - 115200 baud
    - 8 data bits
    - 1 stop bit
    - no parity
    - no flow control

On executing this program You will see messages appearing on the UART terminal 
at periodic intervals. The messages are displayed when the timer interrupt 
occurs.

                                Target hardware
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This example project can be used on PolarFire SoC FPGA family hardware platforms
as well as the PolarFire SoC model on Renode emulation platform. 

There are configurations that needs to be set for this example project. The
configurations are categorized into hardware and software configurations and 
are respectively located in the following folders
    ./mpfs_config/hw_config
    ./mpfs_config/sw_config

The "hw_config" defines the hardware configurations such as clocks. You must 
make sure that the configurations in this example project match the actual 
configurations of your target design you are using to test this example project.

The "sw_config" folder defines the software configurations such as HART 
configurations. These configurations have no dependency on the hardware
configurations that you use. If you change these configurations, you may have 
to change the software code to work according to the new configurations that 
you use.

## Executing project in the Renode emulation

To launch the PolarFire Soc Icicle board emulation model on Renode from 
SoftConsole , launch the preconfigured external tool from
   Run -> External Tools -> "PolarFire-SoC-Icicle-Renode-emulation-platform". 

This will also launch an UART terminal which works with Renode.

Build the project and launch the debug configuration named 
PSE_RV64_periodic_irq Debug_renode.launch which is configured for Renode. 


## Executing project on PolarFire SoC hardware

The same application can be used on PolarFire SoC hardware platform. The MMUART0
must be connected to host PC. The host PC must connect to the serial port using 
a terminal emulator such as Tera Term or PuTTY.

Build the project and launch the debug configuration named 
PSE_RV64_periodic_irq Debug.launch which is configured for PolarFire SoC 
hardware platform.
