                    PolarFire SoC SPI Master Slave example
================================================================================

This example project demonstrates the use of the PolarFire SoC MSS SPI peripheral
device. It loops back communications internally between MSS SPI0 and MSS SPI1. 
In this example project SPI0 is configured in master mode while SPI1 is 
configured in slave mode. The data is then sent from master to slave and slave 
to master to demonstrate the functionality.

                            How to use this example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The example project is targeted to PolarFire SoC hardware platform. The SPI0 is 
configured in master mode whereas SPI1 is the slave. The data is then 
transferred between SPI0 and SPI1 using internal loopback mechanism.
Run the example project using a debugger. Place watches on the following buffers
buffers and observe the contents of the master and slave buffers being
exchanged.

  g_master_tx_buffer,
  g_master_rx_buffer,
  g_slave_tx_buffer,
  g_slave_rx_buffer

NOTE: In Release mode, Debugging level is set to default(-g) so that user 
can put the breakpoint and check the buffer.

                                Target hardware
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This example project can be used on the PolarFire SoC FPGA family hardware 
platforms. 

There are configurations that needs to be set for this example project. The
configurations are categorized into hardware and software configurations and 
are respectively located in the following folders
    platform/config/hardware/hw_config
    platform/config/software/mpfs_hal/mss_sw_config

The "hw_config" defines the hardware configurations such as clocks. You must 
make sure that the configurations in this example project match the actual 
configurations of your target design you are using to test this example project.

The "sw_config" folder defines the software configurations such as HART 
configurations. These configurations have no dependency on the hardware
configurations that you use. If you change these configurations, you may have 
to change the software code to work according to the new configurations that 
you use.

## Executing project on PolarFire SoC hardware

Build the project and launch the debug configuration named 
mpfs-spi-master-slave hw-emulation all-harts debug.launch which is configured for 
PolarFire SoC hardware platform.
