/*
 * Packet manipulation macros for dealing with copies that may not be aligned
 *
 * the _IN macros take data from the packet and the _OUT macros write data
 * to the packet. The packet pointer is assumed to be a pointer to uint8_t
 * and is adjusted based on the length of data.
 *
 * The move operations assume data is in correct order. The write and read
 *  operations follow the high byte first, low byte last order (except for the
 *  block read/write).
 *
 * All macros follow the memcpy(), destination, source approach.
